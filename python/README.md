# Python 1: Beginning Python
---
In course, you will learn the basics of programming with Python. You will learn about expressions, variables, conditionals, loops, lists, sets, dicts, functions, objects, and exceptions.

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

* Store and manipulate user-input data using Python.
* Implement basic Python decisions, iteration, sequence containers, sets, and dicts.
* Read and write files using Python.
* Define custom functions and call built-in Python functions.
* Import modules and namespaces from the Python Standard Library.
* Define classes and instantiate objects using Python’s Class mechanism.
* Handle exceptions and document code.
* Build and debug an entire program written in Python.

From beginning to end, you will learn by doing Python-based projects and submitting them for instructor feedback.  These projects, as well as the final project, will add to your portfolio and will contribute to certificate completion.  Courses are delivered using the CodeRunner learning IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and require only that you be online and able to use a browser. Besides a browser and Internet connection, all software is provided online by the O’Reilly School of Technology.

# Python 2: Getting More out of Python
---
In this course, you will learn more in-depth techniques and strategies for programming with Python. You will get hands-on experience with Python’s modular unit testing features; file handling, storage, and archival; graphical user interfaces; and technologies for working with databases and email.

Upon completion of this online Python course, you will be able to:

Demonstrate understanding of Agile processes and test-driven development.
Manage files, persistent storage, archives, and serialization.
Create a Graphical User Interface in Python.
Design and implement relational databases using Python and SQL.
Create and send emails from Python programs.
Build a full-fledged Python database application.
From beginning to end, you will learn by doing Python-based projects and submitting them for instructor feedback.  These projects, as well as the final project, will add to your portfolio and will contribute to certificate completion.  Courses are delivered using the Eclipse-based Ellipse learning IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and require only that you be online and able to use a browser. Besides a browser and Internet connection, all software is provided online by the O’Reilly School of Technology.
