Write a GUI-based program to build a window layout as shown below. When the frame is resized,
the buttons should stay the same height and expand sideways. Frame 1 and Frame 2 should always be
the same height and width as each other, and Frame 3 should be half as wide again as they are
(i.e. 150% wider, as shown below).  Labeling each Frame is optional / good exercise.
