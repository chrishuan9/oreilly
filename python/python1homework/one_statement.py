#Lesson 1, objective 1
# This simple project is designed to remind you how to create and run a program, and to show how to submit homework projects.. Go through the following steps, referring to the course notes if you get stuck.
# Create a new file.
# Enter the four lines of code shown in the editor window below:
# "Simple one-statement module with docstring."
# print("""This is a very simple program
# that, when run, will verify I can create,
# save, and run programs in CodeRunner.""")
# Save the file (we recommend creating and using a folder for this and all of your homework separate from your /python1 folder with a recognizable name like /python1homework) as one_statement.py.
# Run it to make sure it works properly.
"Simple one-statement module with docstring."
