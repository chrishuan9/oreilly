# AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers (Mosaic/X 2.1+) uncompress

# AddLanguage allows you to specify the language of a document. You can
# then use content negotiation to give a browser a file in a language
# it can understand.  Note that the suffix does not have to be the same
# as the language keyword --- those with documents in Polish (whose
# net-standard language code is pl) may wish to use "AddLanguage pl .po" 
# to avoid the ambiguity with the common suffix for perl scripts.
#
AddLanguage en .en
AddLanguage fr .fr

# LanguagePriority allows you to give precedence to some languages
# in case of a tie during content negotiation.
# Just list the languages in decreasing order of preference.

#
# AddType allows you to tweak mime.types without actually editing it, or to
# make certain files to be certain types.
#
# For example, the PHP3 module (not part of the Apache distribution - see
# http://www.php.net) will typically use:
#
AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3
AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps
AddType text/vnd.wap.wml             .wml
AddType text/vnd.wap.wmlscript       .wmls
AddType text/x-versit .vcf
AddType text/x-nowevent .vef
AddType text/xml .xml
AddType text/xml .xsl


#
# AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers",
# actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
# or added with the Action command (see below)
#
# If you want to use server side includes, or CGI outside
# ScriptAliased directories, uncomment the following lines.
#
# To use CGI scripts:
#
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
AddHandler cgi-script .pl
AddHandler cgi-script .exe
#
# To use server-parsed HTML files
#
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
#
# Uncomment the following line to enable Apache's send-asis HTTP file
# feature
#
#AddHandler send-as-is asis
#
# If you wish to use server-parsed imagemap files, use
#
#AddHandler imap-file map
#
# To enable type maps, you might want to use
#
#AddHandler type-map var
#
# Action lets you define media types that will execute a script whenever
# a matching file is called. This eliminates the need for repeated URL
# pathnames for oft-used CGI file processors.
# Format: Action media/type /cgi-script/location
# Format: Action handler-name /cgi-script/location
#
#
# MetaDir: specifies the name of the directory in which Apache can find
# meta information files. These files contain additional HTTP headers
# to include when sending the document
#
#MetaDir .web
#
# MetaSuffix: specifies the file name suffix for the file containing the
# meta information.
